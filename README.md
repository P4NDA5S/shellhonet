ShellHonet is a honeypot system designed to catch and prevent brute force attacks on SSH services. The system acts as a trap by providing fake commands that trick attackers and record their activities. ShellHonet aims to minimize security risks by detecting and analyzing attacks, so that network administrators can take preventive measures early. Although still in the testing phase, ShellHonet continues to be developed to increase its effectiveness in dealing with various security threats, especially brute force attacks.
